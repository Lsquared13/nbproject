<h1> Glossary</h1>
<ul>
  <li id="item-activepage">
    <b>Active page</b>
    <div class="definition"> This is the page for which annotations are currently being displayed, and that you can annotate by dragging a area on the PDF with your mouse. <br/><img src="/content/data/img/activepage.png"/></div></li>

  <li id="item-collageview">
    <b>Collage View</b>
    <div class="definition">  A collage view displays a collection of <a href="#item-thread">threads</a> along with some preview of the material that is related to that annotation. Unlike the <a href="#item-documentview">Document View</a>, the Collage View focuses on the annotations rather than on the material itself. The figure below shows a sample Collage View.  <br/><img src="/content/data/img/collageview.png"/></div></li>
  
  <li id="item-contextmenu">
    <b>Context Menu </b>
    <div class="definition">
      <span class="n">n</span><span class="b">b</span> uses context menus to avoid UI clutter. When you're on any <a href="#item-note">note</a> of an expanded <a href="#item-thread">thread</a>, you can open the context menu by right-clicking on that note (mac users: Control+click) or by clicking on the <i>options...</i> link located in that note.  
  </div></li>

  <li id="item-documentview">
    <b>Document View</b>
    <div class="definition"> The Document View displays a PDF document in the browser (similar to a regular PDF reader) along with annotations.</div></li>

  <li id="item-favorite">
    <b>Favorites</b>
    <div class="definition">
      A comment that you've marked as favorite, using the <a href="#item-contextmenu">Context Menu</a>. You can choose to see only favorite comments as you read along. From the home page you can monitor new ongoing discussions related to your favorite comments. 
  </div></li>
  
  
  <li id="item-fulltext-search">
    <b>Full text search </b>
    <div class="definition">
      All your annotations on <span class="n">n</span><span class="b">b</span> are searchable (but the contents of the PDFs themselves isn't searchable yet). Use the following tips to improve your searches. <ul>
	<li><b>Avoid substrings that aren't real words in the search bar.</b> <span class="n">n</span><span class="b">b</span> uses an index optimized for search expressions that are real English words. For example, searching for <em>cla</em> may not return any result, but searching for <em>class</em> may return hundreds of results.</li>
	<li><b>The order of the search terms doesn't matter.</b> For instance, searching for <em>middle class</em> and <em>class middle</em> will return the same results. </li>
	<li><b>Use your own strings to create your bookmarks, tags and collections.</b> <span class="n">n</span><span class="b">b</span> doesn't have a feature for users to group their annotations using custom tags or collections (yet...).  However, you can simulate that feature in the following way: Assuming you've found an interesting place in the lecture, just write a private annotation on that place (or write a private reply to an exisiting note, if there's already a note at that place) .This new annotations should contain a unique string that you will easily remember made of letters, digits, and the hyphen character "-" (e.g. <em>review-for-6042-final</em>). You can then use this string in the <span class="n">n</span><span class="b">b</span> search bar to find all the annotations that you've marked with that string.</li>
      </ul>
  </div></li>

  <li id="item-globalcomment">
    <b>Global Comment</b>
    <div class="definition">
      A type of <a href="#item-note">note</a> that isn't related to any particular location in the text. Writing global comments are appropriate to write reflections on the document as a whole, rather that focusing on some precise locations in the material.
  </div></li>
  
  <li id="item-note">
    <b>Note</b>
    <div class="definition">
      A single annotation written about the open document. There are essentially 3 ways to create a note. 
      <ol>
	<li>To create a new <a href="#item-thread">thread</a> about some region of the PDF material, drag your mouse cursor over that region of the PDF. An in-place editor will appear, where you can type your note, and save it. </li>
	<li>To create a <a href="#item-globalcomment">global comment</a> on that PDF, click on <img src="/content/data/icons/png/pen_24.png"/> or or the "New..." link located on the top right corner of the document  </li>
	<li>To reply to an existing note, click the <i>Reply</i> button on the <a href="#item-contextmenu">context menu</a>. </li>
      </ol>
  </div></li>


  <li id="item-thread">
    <b>Thread</b>
    <div class="definition">Threads are conversations, and they consists of one or many <a href="#item-note">notes</a> about the same location in the text. You can add a note to a thread by clicking the <i>Reply</i> button on the <a href="#item-contextmenu">context menu</a>. By default, NB shows you many threads in Collapsed Form (indicated by a '>'). To expand a thread, just click anywhere on that thread.<br/> Note that expanding a thread also highlights and scrolls the PDF so that you can see what location in the material this thread discusses. </div></li>

</ul>
