  <h1>Welcome to the new NB !</h1>
  We've been working hard to make NB more fun to use, but now, we need your help: Currently, NB only knows you as <b>{{user_form.instance.email}}</b>. Conversations are much more pleasant when people know who they're talking to. 
  </div>
  <div id="form">
  <b>Hence, please take a few moments to enter your...</b>.  
  
    <form action="" method="post">
      <table>
	{% for field in user_form %}
	
	<tr>
        <td>{{ field.label_tag }} </td>  <td>{{ field}}</td>{% if field.errors %}<td>{{ field.errors}}</td>	{% endif %}

	</tr>
	
        {% endfor %}  
	
      </table>
          {{ user_form.non_field_errors }} 
               
<div><input style="margin-top: 10px", type="submit" value="Send" /></div>	   
    </form>

    <b>Note</b><i> The new NB has a few notables differences with the old version:</i>
    <ul>
    	<li>It works with many more browsers, including Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer 9</li>
    	<li>By default, your comments are signed. This makes discussions much more pleasant. If you wish to remain anonymous when posting a comment, check the <b>Anonymous</b> option when writing a post. Please note that some classes may not allow anonymous comments, and that your class staff can see your name even on anonymous comments.</li>
    	<li>Some features are still upcoming, such as <ul><li>Collage Views</li><li>Fulltext Search</li><li>Rating comments</li></ul></li>
    	</ul>
    </div>
