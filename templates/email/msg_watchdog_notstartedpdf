Dear NB Administrator, 

The following PDF conversion process(es) on the {{hostname}} server haven't started for a while. If you think that this isn't normal, please check the processing queue, and clear it if necessary, so that new PDF documents can be processed. 

{% for o in objs %}
File {{o.source.title}} (id={{o.source.id}}) was submitted on: {{o.submitted}}
{% endfor %}

Dutifully yours,
NBNB  -  the NB Notification Bot
