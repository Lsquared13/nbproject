Dear NB Administrator, 

A PDF conversion process has been going on for {{processtime}}. If you think that this isn't normal, please check the processing queue, and clear it if necessary, so that new PDF documents can be processed. 

File:         {{o.source.title}} (id={{o.source.id}}, {{o.source.numpages}} pages)
Server:       {{hostname}}

Dutifully yours,
NBNB  -  the NB Notification Bot
